            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I am r134x7 also known as ggx2ac, I am currently studying via<br> 
                online coding bootcamp to gain programming skills and to build <br>
                my portfolio so that I can find a career in web development.<br>
                My educational background is a Bachelor of Science with a double major<br>
                in Physics and, Financial Mathematics and Statistics. <br> 
                <br>
                My programming experience during University consisted of:<br>
                learning Matlab for scientific applications and R language for<br>
                applying statistics. After University, I learned Java (self-taught)<br>
                to display finacial data in code printed format. I then taught myself<br>
                Python to build new code for that same data because the Java IDE mobile<br>
                app I was using no longer worked and there was no satisfactory replacement.<br>
